# EthereumBank
Dug this up from the archives.

Ever wanted a safe place to store your funds from multiple Ethereum Wallets?

Try this decentralized banking application that was developed by a 14 year old!

Pretty sure this was one of my first smart contracts--I am not liable for any damages you incur by using this code. Doing so is negligent in and of itself. 

I updated the pragma version and added events, so it should work to some extent...Hopefully? When I was in highschool and had never programmed outside of Roblox, getting this to work at all was a big deal, so cut me some slack.
